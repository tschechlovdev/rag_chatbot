This method has shown significant speed improvements in tasks like classification and regression, with a speedup of 5,140\u00d7 and 3,000\u00d7 respectively. TabPFN also demonstrates characteristics of foundation models, such as fine-tuning, generative abilities, and density estimation. The model is based on in-context learning (ICL), the same mechanism that has led to impressive performance in large language models.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {"model": "granite3.3", "created_at": "2025-05-02T10:14:45.613219Z", "done": true, "done_reason": "stop", "total_duration": 3133508542, "load_duration": 3597625, "prompt_eval_count": 429, "prompt_eval_duration": 776000000, "eval_count": 125, "eval_duration": 2353000000, "model_name": "granite3.3"}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": "run-d578bb1e-1c9a-4def-8c88-9a29ffa3c6d0-0", "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": {"input_tokens": 429, "output_tokens": 125, "total_tokens": 554}}}]
